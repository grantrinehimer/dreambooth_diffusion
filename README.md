## Environment

Try to use the environment.yaml to make a conda environment. Honestly, this might not work so if not just make sure you're using python 3.10 and install packages with pip as needed. You could also try the requirements.txt as well (although diffusers has to be installed manually through cloning the repo to your computer).
